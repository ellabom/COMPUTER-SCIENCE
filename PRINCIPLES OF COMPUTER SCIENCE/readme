introducing additional problem solving methods and computer science principles, to solve larger problems that are more data intensive, or require more sophisticated techniques. These principles include data structures for efficient storage and retrieval of data, selection of appropriate data structures, algorithmic paradigms for solving difficult problems, and analysis of algorithms time and space requirements
