1. My plan did not take long to create, at most between 10 to 15 mins 

2. I did not really revise my design and no, there was no significant difference, I followed everything i planned step by step,
   although for the last function, I wanted it to prompt the user to enter the filename but decided to go about that another way.

3. Yes, the implementation and debugging phase for some functions took longer than expected. I overestimated my understanding of the task
   especially in situations involving indexing. I think one way to avoid this problem is, after reading the requirements if I am still not
   sure on how to go about it I'd have to do a little research or refer back to similar examples.
