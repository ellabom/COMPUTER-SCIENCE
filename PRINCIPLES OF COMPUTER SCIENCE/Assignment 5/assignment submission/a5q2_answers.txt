1. example1 == example2 returns False. A node chain is not like a python list which you can 
   analyse as an overall container of values and compare with another similar list. Node chains
   are not builtins like list, so to determine if example1 and example2 are equal we'd have to 
   access each value in the node chain and compare

2. example1 = N.node(1, N.node(2, N.node(3)))
   example3 = double_chain(example1)
   example4 = N.node(2, N.node(4, N.node(6)))
   test = a5.check_chains(example3, example4)
   expected = 'same values'
   reason = 'nodes are equal'

   if test != expected:
	print('Test failed: got {}, expected {}, reason: {}'.format(test, expected, reason))
