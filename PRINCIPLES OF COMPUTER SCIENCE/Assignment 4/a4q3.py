# Synopsis:
#    Defines the GradeItem and the Student class
#
# A Grade Item is anything a course uses in a grading scheme,
# like a test or an assignment.
#
# A Student is a record of a student's identity, and includes the student's
# grade items.

    # which defines how much the item counts towards a final grade.
