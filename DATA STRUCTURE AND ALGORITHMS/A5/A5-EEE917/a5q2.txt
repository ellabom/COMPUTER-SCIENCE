4. The tree quest log would be preferred because it is sufficent to display in alphabetical order,
   because it is traverses through the tree in order and no need to visit any node more then once, while
   the hashQuestlog needs to be sorted first with the .sort() method which increases the time complexit

5. The hashQuestlog would be suitable, because it the keys methods obtains the keys fast, there is no need to go 
   through each index one by one to get an item from the array. With the tree, we probaly would have to search
   the entire tree.
