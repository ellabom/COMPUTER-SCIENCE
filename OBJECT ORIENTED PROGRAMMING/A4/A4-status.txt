STATUS:
The student and manager classes from the test cases work alright, except for the toString 
method in the Manager class results in an error. The method prints out the same thing as the expected output
but the test case fails, could be from whitespace.
The changes made to the Residence class provided for A4 work fine, some test cases were added to make sure
the changed don't cause more damage to the program.

For the StudentResidenceSystem, all the function were correctly implemented with the scanner for console user input.
The displayEmptyBeds() and releaseStudent() were not implemented as instructed in the requirements. The main method asks the user for console input and correctly displays the information.
